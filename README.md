# Cobble Hill Shopify Theme

This is the base theme all Cobble Hill Shopify sites will use here on out.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the theme up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. For first time installation be sure to read PREREQUISITES first, to insure the theme will download correctly. See DEPLOYMENT for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
